# Project Pufferfish

## Purpose
Treat the pufferfish emoji as an object. You can add them, subtract them, increment them, and more.

## TODO
1. When you input a string, if there is a blank line, the input will not continue to read everything in the input buffer. Rather, it will stop reading and the next read will continue reading from where the first reader left off.
2. Allow strings to be valid representations of this class. In other words, create a function to map from a string to the class (you already define the __str__ function) and accept this as valid input everywhere that you accept an int or Pufferfish class as a valid input
3. Figure out how to give type hints that something should be a Pufferfish (i.e. "type(self)")

## Note
I am actually not working on this project. It was for a joke and I am just putting the code on Github for fun!
